# README

I am in no way sure about the namingconventions regarding the EJBs, therefor I ended up with naming them {EntityName}Bean.

I didn't have time to finish the rest of the Entity tests, and the EJB-features are fairly limited (only findById and persist), but I will update those at a later stage.
