AA:


- project does not compile due to "PostJpa" name mismatch. Java is case sensitive, and
 Windows is not. However, this type of issue will be easily spot once
 we ll discuss continuous integration systems (eg Travis)


- Good use of references in LocalDateAttributeConverter


- "service"s do not seem to be EJB (@Stateful, @Stateless, @Singleton), but rather
 classes in which EntityManagers are passed by constructor. This will likely lead to
 quite a few issues when dealing with actual database, dependency injection and
 calls from web-layer.


- Testing of EJB services should be done with a EJB container, so that you can
 check if transactions are properly handled. Although I realize I should have
 made it more clear in the exercise text.
