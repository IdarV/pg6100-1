AA:

- why is the entity Comment marked as @Stateless ?

- package names should be lower cases (eg see "Constraints" and "Enum")

- transactions are marked with "transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL"" and not
with "transaction-type="JTA"". As such, transactions should had done manually
in all the EJBs. This is done in the tests, but not directly in the EJB.
However, consequences will be clear once we will also have the web-layer.


- Testing of EJB services should be done with a EJB container, so that you can
 check if transactions are properly handled. Although I realize I should have
 made it more clear in the exercise text.
